find difference between accessing variable of class without creating object and creating object

Ans:-Class variables are shared between all instances and can be accessed directly through that class without 
having to create an object.This is because instance variables are unique to each object and need to be instantiated to access them.
Modifying a class variable affects all instances of the class because they share the same variable.Modifying an instance 
variable affects that specific instance.
